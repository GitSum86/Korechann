# Korechann - K-Pop Music Video Monitoring Bot

Korechann is an automated Python-based service that monitors trusted K-Pop YouTube channels for new music video releases (it can be configured for other trusted channels).

It sends push notifications directly to your mobile device via Telegram account when new popular videos are detected, based on configurable view thresholds and timing windows.

You can optionally auto-download the videos to a local NAS or storage location, with generated metadata files for media libraries like Kodi.
